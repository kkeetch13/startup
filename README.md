## Elevator Pitch:
My website portfolio showcases my journey as a political science and computer science double major, blending analytical problem-solving with technical expertise. It highlights projects in programming, data analysis, and web development, along with an interactive game reflecting my creative approach. Take a look into my portfolio to see who I am as a person, my resume, and my techincal project history.
## Key Features:
Overview of projects completed showcasing technical skills, a resume, a game created by me, and an about me page.
## HTML: 
Basic parts of the website for navigation, layout, etc.
## CSS: 
Colors, images, font, overall design focus to make it look professional
## JavaScript: 
I plan to make a simple game, which will require JavaScript to function, such as hangman, a reaction time test, typing test, or mastermind game.
## React: 
Game: Implement the interactive game, reactive to user actions.
## Web Service: 
Save visitor interactions, like game scores or comments.
## Authentication: 
Enabling users to log in and save their high scores from the implemented game.
## Database Data:
Store visitor login credentials for personalized access and save user interactions, like game scores or form submissions.
## WebSocket:
Add a real-time feature: When a visitor interacts with the portfolio (e.g., submits a game score or leaves a comment), broadcast it to all other users viewing the portfolio in real time.
## Mock-up Design

4/1/25 Added CSS for each page, ensuring to fulfill each requirement

HTML Structure
I focused on writing clean and semantic HTML. Each page uses proper structural elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> to maintain accessibility and clarity. While I initially duplicated the header and footer code across pages, I plan to refactor these into reusable React components, streamlining my codebase for future updates.

CSS & Responsive Design
Creating the visual style of the website was both challenging and rewarding. I spent several hours fine-tuning CSS to ensure responsiveness, and Bootstrap proved invaluable for this process. Although Bootstrap’s styling can feel quite opinionated, it allowed me to quickly set up a responsive layout—especially with the navbar, which provided an excellent, mobile-friendly header.

React Part 1: Client-Side Routing
Leveraging Vite with React made the initial setup quick and efficient, although I did encounter some CSS conflicts between components. Resolving these issues not only taught me more about CSS scoping but also led me to embrace the modular structure that client-side routing offers. This organization has improved my development workflow and enhanced the overall maintainability of the site.

React Part 2: Enhancing User Interaction
The transition to React’s state management was a pivotal moment in the project. Moving away from traditional DOM manipulation to a more reactive paradigm simplified the process of adding interactivity. One particularly engaging task was handling checkbox toggles for a sound selection feature. Using React’s state hook allowed me to keep the UI in sync with user interactions.
