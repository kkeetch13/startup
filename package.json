  "description": "My website portfolio showcases my journey as a political science and computer science double major, blending analytical problem-solving with technical expertise. It highlights projects in programming, data analysis, and web development, along with an interactive game reflecting my creative approach. Take a look into my portfolio to see who I am as a person, my resume, and my techincal project history. ## Key Features: Overview of projects completed showcasing technical skills, a resume, a game created by me, and an about me page. ## HTML:  Basic parts of the website for navigation, layout, etc. ## CSS:  Colors, images, font, overall design focus to make it look professional ## JavaScript:  I plan to make a simple game, which will require JavaScript to function, such as hangman, a reaction time test, typing test, or mastermind game. ## React:  Game: Implement the interactive game, reactive to user actions. ## Web Service:  Save visitor interactions, like game scores or comments. ## Authentication:  Enabling users to log in and save their high scores from the implemented game. ## Database Data: Store visitor login credentials for personalized access and save user interactions, like game scores or form submissions. ## WebSocket: Add a real-time feature: When a visitor interacts with the portfolio (e.g., submits a game score or leaves a comment), broadcast it to all other users viewing the portfolio in real time. ## Mock-up Design ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17617de8-9dba-492b-af13-9ca025bcc09a)",
